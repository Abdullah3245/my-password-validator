# render.yaml
# A minimal Blueprint that sets up one Python web service using Flask + Gunicorn.

services:
  - name: my-password-validator   # A password validator file
    type: web                     # "web" means it's publicly accessible
    runtime: python               # Using Python environment on Render
    plan: free                    # Use the free instance type (change if you need bigger)
    branch: main                  # The branch Render will build from (adjust as needed)
    # Install pipenv and then install dependencies via the Pipfile/Pipfile.lock
    buildCommand: pip install pipenv && pipenv install --deploy
    # Run the app using pipenv, which ensures your environment is set correctly.
    startCommand: pipenv run gunicorn main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
    envVars:
      - key: FLASK_ENV
        value: production
      # If you need environment secrets, see "sync: false" or environment groups in the docs.
    
    # Optionally set region (if omitted, defaults to Oregon)
    # see: https://render.com/docs/regions
    region: ohio

    # If your repo is different from the default (the same repo that holds this render.yaml),
    # you can specify the 'repo' field. For example:
    # repo: https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
